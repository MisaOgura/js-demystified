# Welcome to JS Demystified Series
It is my humble attempt to demystify tricky concepts in JavaScript.

It originally started out on [Medium](https://medium.com/@misaogura), and has been adopted
to tech.io platform to implement **runnable snippets** for better reading experiences.

The source code of this playground can be found on [Github](https://github.com/MisaOgura/js-demystified)

# Who this is for?
This series aims to discuss some of the tricky concepts such as _hoisting_, _scope_, and
_execution context_ in great detail. Therefore, it's recommended that you have some experience
with JavaScript and are familiar with its syntax.
