# Welcome to JS Demystified Series!
It is my humble attempt to demystify tricky concepts in JavaScript.

It originally started out on [Medium](https://medium.com/@misaogura), and has been adopted
to tech.io platform to implement **runnable snippets** for better reading experiences.

The source code of this playground can be found on [Github](https://github.com/MisaOgura/js-demystified).

# Who this is for?
This series aims to discuss some of the tricky concepts in great detail. Therefore,
it's recommended that you have _some experience with JavaScript_ and are _familiar
with its syntax_.

# Topics
Here is a list of topics that have been published on Medium, which I am going to
adopt into this playground. The list will be updated as I add more contents.

1. Variable Hoisting
2. Function Hoisting
3. Scope
4. Execution Context
5. Closures

Okay, let's dive into it!
