# Welcome to JS Demystified Series!
It is my humble attempt to demystify tricky concepts in JavaScript.

It originally started out on [Medium](https://medium.com/@misaogura), and has been adopted
to tech.io platform to implement **runnable snippets** for better reading experiences.

The source code of this playground can be found on [Github](https://github.com/MisaOgura/js-demystified).

# Who this is for?
This series aims to discuss some of the tricky concepts such as _hoisting_, _scope_, and
_execution context_ in great detail. Therefore, it's recommended that you have **some experience
with JavaScript** and are **familiar with its syntax**.

# Topics
Here is a list of topics that have been published on Medium, which I am going to
adopt into this playground. It will be updated as I add more contents.

1. Variable Hoisting
2. Function Hoisting
3. Scope
4. Execution Context
5. Closures

Okay, enough talking, let's dive into it.
